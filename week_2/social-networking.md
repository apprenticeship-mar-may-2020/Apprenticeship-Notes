#### Social Networking:
I copied this code - it seems we will do the social networking kata in a couple of weeks:

##### Refactoring

I did have a look at this for Refactoring:
Martin Fowler Refactoring the Design of Existing Code:

https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~r95004/Refactoring_improving_the_design_of_existing_code.pdf

This book is clearly the inspiration for the Refactoring guru website (many of the chapters are exactly the same):

Exercise
Implement a console-based social networking application (similar to Twitter) satisfying the scenarios below.

Scenarios
Posting: Alice can publish messages to a personal timeline

> Alice -> I love the weather today
> Bob -> Damn! We lost!
> Bob -> Good game though.
Reading: Bob can view Alice's timeline

> Alice
I love the weather today (5 minutes ago)
> Bob
Good game though. (1 minute ago)
Damn! We lost! (2 minutes ago)
Following: Charlie can subscribe to Alice's and Bob's timelines, and view an aggregated list of all subscriptions

> Charlie -> I'm in New York today! Anyone want to have a coffee?
> Charlie follows Alice
> Charlie wall
Charlie - I'm in New York today! Anyone want to have a coffee? (2 seconds ago)
Alice - I love the weather today (5 minutes ago)

> Charlie follows Bob
> Charlie wall
Charlie - I'm in New York today! Anyone wants to have a coffee? (15 seconds ago)
Bob - Good game though. (1 minute ago)
Bob - Damn! We lost! (2 minutes ago)
Alice - I love the weather today (5 minutes ago)
Details
The application must use the console for input and output.
Users submit commands to the application. There are four commands. 'posting', 'reading', etc. are not part of the commands; commands always start with the user's name.
posting: <user name> -> <message>
reading: <user name>
following: <user name> follows <another user>
wall: <user name> wall
Don't worry about handling any exceptions or invalid commands. Assume that the user will always type the correct commands. Just focus on the sunny day scenarios.
Don't bother making it work over a network or across processes. It can all be done in memory, assuming that users will all use the same terminal.
Non-existing users should be created as they post their first message. Application should not start with a pre-defined list of users.
Exercise should be done either in Java or C#.
Provide instructions on how to run the application.
IMPORTANT: Focus on writing the best code you can produce. Do not rush. Take as much time as you need; there is no deadline.
