#### This was Mattsi's feedback:
Hey Tom, I hope you enjoyed the pairing session on Friday! I have just emailed you Mattsi's feedback but it can be found here for reference too:

I forked Mattsi's github account for dotfiles:
https://github.com/TomSpencerLondon/dotfiles

This was his Github description:
```
Prerequisites
macOS. Installs Brew and all other dependencies automatically.

Setup
git clone git@github.com:Mattsi-Jansky/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
~/.dotfiles/init.sh
Run refresh-dotfiles to update configuration changes after the first install. This calls a separate script, update.sh. Update is re-entrant and idempotent; install nearly is except for iTerm complaining about duplicate colour schemes, so it's best to use refresh-dotfiles after the initial setup.

Acknowledgents
Adam Eivy, several of the bash files are hacked together from bits of his dotfiles.
Nick Charlton and thoughtbot, I learned about Brewfiles and a few other bits by reading their dotfiles.
```
