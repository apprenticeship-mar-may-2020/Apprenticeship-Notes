##### Sherlock presentation Monday

This included the following slides which were useful:
This slide sumarised the leading reasons for failure of projects. The most important was changing or poorly documented requirements:

This was the feedback loops slide. It summarised the importance of simplicity, communication, feedback, courage and respect:

This slide summarised the need for baby steps when working towards a solution with TDD:

I found this useful because when we iterated the same problem 3 times we were struck by the way that the solution to the algorithm seemed to emerge from the series of tests. I would like to use this technique further.

Sherlock spoke about these summaries for the TDD process. Triangulate was a term that was emphasised - this meant use more specific tests to drive a more generic solution.

The main rule that stuck out here was not to refactor when tests were failing.

This slide summarised the driver/ navigator switch techniques. We had the following techniques to choose from chess clock (switch after a predefined time interval), ping pong Dev A writes a RED test DEV B writes code to pass the test. DEV B writes a RED test. Dev A writes code to pass it etc:

Finally we had Pomodoro which involved setting the pomodoro timer at x minutes and when it rings take a short break and switch.
