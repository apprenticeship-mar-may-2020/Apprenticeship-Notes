Manifesto for Agile Software Development

We are uncovering better ways of developing
software by doing it and helping others do it.
Through this work we have come to value:

- Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
- Working software over comprehensive documentation
- Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
- Responding to change over following a plan

That is, while there is value in the items on
the right, we value the items on the left more.
```
- Seb: value of process rather than bureaucracy - not detailed documentation
- Unit testing part of documentation
- build working software
- customer collaboration - feedback from whoever you are building software - original plan is end goal
- Waterfall project - analysis and estimation of cost and time - number - yes or no according to that number
- something changes => request for change - all of this documentation needs lawyers and approval
- there is a legal framework but it is more important to collaborate with the customer to fulfil their needs. 
- responding to change: context may change - we need to be able to adapt
- Gantt chart to show based on work what will take. Planning upfront. Approval or not. Someone sick - things take more or less time.
- Planning is important - priority should be to adapt to change
- Agile approach change on legacy?
- Payment plan for e-commerce - microservices 
- COVID-19 short term - make sure that what is hurting the business - people cancelling - focus moves
- Ringfield - something has changed we need to adapt
- People and how people interact is more important
- inefficient processes that people skip - mobile phone - bring my own phone and test with my phone
- tools should be in service of individuals
- Agile over project management - planning tools lightweight and adaptable because they know it will need to change
- To create a Gantt chart takes days and can slow change
- configure once and not change - Jira - bad rep (how we are using the tool)

#####Â We follow these principles:
```
Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer
through early and continuous delivery
of valuable software.
```
```
- Welcome changing requirements, even late in
development. Agile processes harness change for
the customer's competitive advantage.

- Deliver working software frequently, from a
couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a
preference to the shorter timescale.

- Business people and developers must work
together daily throughout the project.

- Build projects around motivated individuals.Give them the environment and support they need,
and trust them to get the job done.

- The most efficient and effective method of
conveying information to and within a development
team is face-to-face conversation.

- Working software is the primary measure of progress.

- Agile processes promote sustainable development.
- The sponsors, developers, and users should be able
to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.

- Continuous attention to technical excellence
and good design enhances agility.

- Simplicity--the art of maximizing the amount
of work not done--is essential.

- The best architectures, requirements, and designs
emerge from self-organizing teams.

- At regular intervals, the team reflects on how
to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts
its behavior accordingly.
