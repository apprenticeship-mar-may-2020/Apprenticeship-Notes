##### This is the video element:
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/video
```
The <video> element is a replaced element — its display value is 
inline by default, but its default width and height in the viewport is 
defined by the video being embedded.

There are no special considerations 
for styling <video>; a common strategy is to give it a display 
value of block to make it easier to position, size, etc., and then 
provide styling and layout information as required. Video 
player styling basics provides some useful styling techniques.

```
CSS Position: Relative vs Position Absolute
Static - this is the default value, all elements are in order as they appear in the document.
Relative - the element is positioned relative to its normal position.
Absolute - the element is positioned absolutely to its first positioned parent.
Fixed - the element is positioned related to the browser window.
```
