This is a technique established by [Alberto Brandolini](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=veTVAN0oEkQ&feature=youtu.be) for modelling domain events within a company. You might be wondering "what is a domain event?". A domain event is something that occurs that is considered important by domain experts. For instance:

* customer placed order
* item was delivered

N.B. domain events are in the past-tense.

When holding an event storming session, it is important that all domain experts are in the room. Brandolini also recommends standing and being active, utilising a long whiteboard (horizontally).

## Stickies Explained
Those of you well versed in the Agile methodology will know stickies all too well. Within event storming, the colour of stickies holds a significance.
