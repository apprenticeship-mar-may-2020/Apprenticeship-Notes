When to use the V Model:

These are Pros and Cons of V Model:

There is also the issue of users not seeing the product until late in the development phase.


##### This is the Agile timeline:

Agile Manifesto principles can be split into 3 main groups:
<img width="810" alt="Screenshot 2020-04-20 at 15 14 32" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/27693622/79761720-bad28000-8319-11ea-8b45-04d5c67f6da1.png">

These are the principles for team communication:

The main point regarding agile is that we have iterative development towards a shared goal


#### These are some common agile misconceptions:

##### XP Programming

- Pairs
- Flat management structure
- Frequent communication with the customer
- Code reviews
This is where XP programming came from (Kent Beck's work with Chrysler)
https://www.martinfowler.com/bliki/C3.html

##### XP Programming 
- 4 x Activities - coding, listening, testing, design
- 5 values -  communication, simplicity, feedback, courage and respect
- 3 principles
- 12 practices
- 29 rules


#### XP Programming 4 activities:

There are 3 main XP principles -

##### Fine Scale Feedback
- Pair Programming
- Planning game
- Test driven development
- Whole team

##### Continuous Process
- Continuous integration
- Refactoring or design improvement
- Small releases


##### Shared understanding
- coding standards (linter etc.)
- collective code ownership
- simple design
- System metaphor

##### Programmer welfare
- sustainable pace


###### Extreme Programming Rules
Extreme programming has 29 rules split into 5 sections:
<img width="1346" alt="Screenshot 2020-04-20 at 16 40 52" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/27693622/79770740-b744f600-8325-11ea-96fc-53bc1a9fa1f7.png">

#### Planning
- user stories are written
- release planning
- make frequent small releases 
- divide project to iterations
- plan each iteration


#### Managing
- give the team an open work space
- set a sustainable pace
- stand up meeting starts each day
- velocity is measured
- change roles
- fix XP when it isn't working

#### Design

- simplicity
- choose a system metaphor
- use CRC cards for design sessions
(which objects send messages to other objects)
- use spike solutions to reduce risk
- no functionality added early
- refactor whenever possible


##### Coding
- Customer is always available
- Code written to agreed standards
- More common to use a tool to ensure code standards
- code the unit test first
- production code is pair programmed
- only one pair integrates code at a time


#### Testing
- All code has unit tests
- All code must pass all unit tests
- when a bug is found tests are created

##### XP diagram:

##### This is the Conscious Capitalism Credo:
```
“We believe that business is good because it creates value, it is ethical because it is based on voluntary exchange, it is noble because it can elevate our existence, and it is heroic because it lifts people out of poverty and creates prosperity. Free enterprise capitalism is the most powerful system for social cooperation and human progress ever conceived. It is one of the most compelling ideas we humans have ever had. But we can aspire to even more.

Conscious Capitalism is a way of thinking about capitalism and business that better reflects where we are in the human journey, the state of our world today, and the innate potential of business to make a positive impact on the world. Conscious businesses are galvanized by higher purposes that serve, align, and integrate the interests of all their major stakeholders. Their higher state of consciousness makes visible to them the interdependencies that exist across all stakeholders, allowing them to discover and harvest synergies from situations that otherwise seem replete with trade-offs. They have conscious leaders who are driven by service to the company’s purpose, all the people the business touches, and the planet we all share together. Conscious businesses have trusting, authentic, innovative and caring cultures that make working there a source of both personal growth and professional fulfillment. They endeavor to create financial, intellectual, social, cultural, emotional, spiritual, physical and ecological wealth for all their stakeholders.

Conscious businesses will help evolve our world so that billions of people can flourish, leading lives infused with passion, purpose, love and creativity; a world of freedom, harmony, prosperity, and compassion.”
```

##### Cynefin Framework
Sense making model - data precedes the framework

- standard capitalist consultancy model:

<img width="353" alt="Screenshot 2020-04-20 at 17 52 45" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/27693622/79777971-eeb8a000-832f-11ea-9331-b429c159297b.png">


<img width="824" alt="Screenshot 2020-04-20 at 17 54 20" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/27693622/79778006-fd9f5280-832f-11ea-83ad-d2f6b3b75581.png">


#### Simple domain:
- cause and effect relationships exist are predictable and repeatable
- sense - categorise - respond
- best practice

##### complicated domain
- relationship between cause and effect is not self evident
- good practice rather than best practice - there are several ways of doing things 
- sense - analyse - respond
- good practice

###### Complex 
- probe - sense - respond
- experiment when we have identified amplify and dampen strategies - not before 
- emergent practice

##### Chaotic 
- Act - sense - respond
- Novel Practice

The Simple zone overlaps as a cliff onto the chaotic zone.

#### Summary:
A decision-making framework that recognises the causal differences that exist between system types and proposes new approaches to decision making in complex social environments.


###### Scrum Guide:
https://www.scrumguides.org/docs/scrumguide/v2017/2017-Scrum-Guide-US.pdf

Developed and sustained by Scrum creators: Ken Schwaber and Jeff Sutherland
```
Scrum Theory
Scrum is founded on empirical process control theory, or empiricism. Empiricism asserts that
knowledge comes from experience and making decisions based on what is known. Scrum
employs an iterative, incremental approach to optimize predictability and control risk.
Three pillars uphold every implementation of empirical process control: transparency,
inspection, and adaptation.
```
```
Transparency
Significant aspects of the process must be visible to those responsible for the outcome.
Transparency requires those aspects be defined by a common standard so observers share a
common understanding of what is being seen.
For example
• A common language referring to the process must be shared by all participants; and,
• Those performing the work and those inspecting the resulting increment must share a
common definition of “Done”.
Inspection
Scrum users must frequently inspect Scrum artifacts and progress toward a Sprint Goal to detect
undesirable variances. Their inspection should not be so frequent that inspection gets in the way
of the work. Inspections are most beneficial when diligently performed by skilled inspectors at
the point of work.
Adaptation
If an inspector determines that one or more aspects of a process deviate outside acceptable
limits, and that the resulting product will be unacceptable, the process or the material being
processed must be adjusted. An adjustment must be made as soon as possible to minimize
further deviation.
Scrum prescribes four formal events for inspection and adaptation, as described in the Scrum
Events section of this document:
• Sprint Planning
• Daily Scrum
• Sprint Review
• Sprint Retrospective
```

The Product Owner is one person, not a committee. The Product Owner may represent the
desires of a committee in the Product Backlog, but those wanting to change a Product Backlog
item’s priority must address the Product Owner.
