Sebastian's knowledge base and confidence has gone from strength to strength thanks in large part to his diligent approach to the subject matter. He is becoming an outstanding craftsman and I was particularly impressed by the way he is now able to implement many of the concepts learnt over the past 4 weeks in improvised algorithm and kata design. Well done Sebastian!

Sebastian always has a clear point of view but is also ready to explore other options and compromise for the sake of the team. I always go away from a session having taken onboard a lot of new concepts after working with Sebastian.

Sebastian really is going from strength to strength in his approach to kata completion. I have loved watching him develop his confidence so that he is able to improvise on Katas. This will be a very useful skill going forwards as he further works on his algorithmic abilities and Systems Design knowledge. The one point I would raise now is to focus further on ways to streamline his propensity for for loops. A clear understanding of this technique is very important but now that he has developed his algorithmic knowledge it may be helpful to start to stretch out more into using other techniques such as streams and optionals. Excellent and enviable understanding of design basics though!

What I have particularly appreciated this week is Sebastian's thoughtful patience and readiness to take time out to work with his colleagues to help them to develop their confidence and understanding. I think this is a great trait and will certainly serve him well as he starts to develop his practice as a craftsman. In all sessions I feel well supported and that my contributions are valued. Outstanding!

###### Any general comments?

You are now really starting to shine as a craftsman and what has particularly impressed me is that you have continued to develop engaging soft skills as a team player alongside your algorithmic development. Thank you again for all your hard work!

Alexis' understanding of Systems design has been a great asset to the group and it has been a pleasure to learn from an advanced practitioner in this regard. I have been consistently impressed by Alexis' considered and thoughtful approach to design decisions and his eagerness to explore the implications of these decisions as they relate to real world applications. Well done Alexis!

##### Actively participates in presentations, discussions, and session?

Alexis is passionate about his craft and this shows well in the team discussions. I have very much enjoyed learning from Alexis' application of design patterns in our more challenging recent katas such as the Hotel Booking kata and have been particularly grateful for his inclusive attitude and eagerness to allow all points of view to be heard so that we can progress as a team with shared knowledge and understanding. This is an excellent trait and one that will serve you well as a craftsman.

Your thirst for knowledge and work ethic are invaluable. You have now started to implement more advanced data structures such as streams and optionals. It has been a real pleasure to work with you as you patiently implement these techniques. One possible point to work on might be to revise your understanding of algorithms alongside your formidable design knowledge. It may be that too much focus on design may cast a shadow on important algorithmic techniques that could further improve your practice. Your understanding of katas and skill in completing them is excellent and enviable!

###### Professional in behaviour; effective, respectful, pragmatic, and collaborative?
You selected 8 - Amazing

You are now developing a strong team lead persona with an enthusiastic and driven approach to task completion. What I particularly like about your leadership style is that you are motivated solely by the success of the team and the clarity and elegance of the proposed solution. Sometimes this eagerness for best practice may lead to longer discussion of possible design decisions but this is all with a view to building a lasting solution that can be carried into professional practice. It has been a pleasure to work with you!

###### Any general comments?

Enthusiastic, driven and uncompromising. You have now developed excellent habits to become an outstanding craftsman. I have very much enjoyed collaborating on katas as you develop your practice. Well done!

I have consistently worked hard to ensure that the knowledge shared is carefully acquired and refined. This diligence has helped me to make useful and insightful contributions to the katas we have worked on. I have continued to improve my understanding of IntelliJ shortcuts and my confidence with kata design is continuing to develop. I am continuing to improve my algorithm knowledge and this has helped to develop my Java knowledge more generally. 

##### Actively participates in presentations, discussions, and session?

I have interesting questions about decisions that are made during programming or about topics that are presented and this frank and precise understand does help to play a role in guiding group progress in kata completion. I am a careful listener and am continuing to work on my contributions so that I am able to take more leadership in design decisions while allowing different voices to be heard in discussion.

I have been consistently praised for visible improvement in usage of previously explained techniques. This is a good trait as it has allowed me to make good progress in developing my algorithmic understanding. Confidence in algorithm design will need to continue to be nurtured going forwards through consistent kata and algorithm practice. There has been some improvement in understanding of Systems design and I will continue to develop this side of my professional development as we move into the next phase of the apprenticeship.

I am enthusiastic, good communicator and patient practitioner.  These characteristics mean that I am a good pair and able to bring the best out of my colleagues. I am continue to develop more confidence in shortcuts on IntelliJ and will continue to work on my Systems design knowledge in order to develop my leadership in pair coding sessions as we face more challenging design decisions.

###### Any general comments?

Good communicator and improved algorithm and design skills alongside more confident framework knowledge. I am continuing to develop my expertise so that I can progress to become an effective software craftsman.

This week Ed has given careful feedback that is directed and focused. He has given clear guidance during kata completion and I have been particularly impressed by his careful contributions during group work in order to lead discussion and enable group progress. He has been careful to ensure that we have continued to develop momentum as a group and this has enabled us to develop on our understanding of the challenges of working with legacy code, refactoring best practices and to further develop our confidence with Outside in TDD and design. 

##### The content was relevant for what I need as craftsperson?
You selected 8 - Amazing

This week I have been given the opportunity to develop my understanding of kata design and algorithm planning in a safe learning environment. The practical advice and personalised guidance have enabled me to develop more confidence in algorithm design and to further develop my knowledge of Design Patterns. Ewan's leadership during the retrospectives has allowed us to develop our knowledge of a broad range of topics and he has consistently been conscientious in his careful research concerning more general questions in order enable continued apprentice progress. 

###### Support was provided as needed at a one-to-one and group level?

The group assessments on Thursday were particularly helpful and a very good idea as they enabled us as craftspeople to feel a bit of inner fire as we worked for kata completion on our own. This formed a good contrast to our earlier mob programming and pair work and did enable a closer feedback loop. One aspect of the course that could be developed might include more focused modelling of best practices for algorithm and kata completion but there have been so many pointers on areas for development particularly during the Thursday sessions. I do think that it might help to develop this style teaching and learning more generally during the course as it does lead to more accountability and certainly helped to focus minds. 

###### Any other comments?

Ed has been a very thoughtful, careful and conscientious teacher. His thoughtful consideration of apprentices' concerns and opening of the curriculum for apprentice progress have enabled us to take develop our learning and further mature our learning. Thank you Ed!
