1. Novice is rigid adherence to taught rules or plans
2. Advanced beginner limited situational perception - all aspects of work treated with equal importance
3. Competent - cope with crowdedness - multiple activities / information, some perception of actions in relation to goals, deliberate planning
4. Proficient - holistic view of the situation - prioritize importance of aspects - perceives deviations in the normal pattern
5. Expert transcends reliance on rules, guidelines and maxims - intuitive grasp of situations based on deep understanding

These days, I’m much more comfortable 
approaching a colleague with something 
rubbish, and asking them to tear it 
apart. Then I can learn from the 
feedback, rinse and repeat. The apprenticeship program makes this possible by design: there’s no 
consequence if you get something wrong, and lack of knowledge is never met with condescension or disdain. It’s just an 
opportunity for growth.

###### Function to get access to the Function keys

To access function keys (F1–F12) on the Touch Bar of your MacBook Pro,
hold down the Function (fn) key at the bottom-left of your keyboard.
The Touch Bar of your MacBook Pro changes to show the function keys for
you to select, and then it returns to its previous state when you release the
Function key.
