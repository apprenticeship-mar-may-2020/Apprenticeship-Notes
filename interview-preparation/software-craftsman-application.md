#### Software Craftsperson London
Craftspeople
3 Sutton Lane, London, UK
##### The Role
We are looking for Software Craftspeople that share the same values of pragmatism, professionalism and transparency that we do. Working exclusively in London (we don’t like to travel very far), we support our clients in many ways and you will have the opportunity to work on a wide range of different internal and client projects.

Perhaps you’ll work on a client project from our offices with our team delivery approach. This may be a greenfield project for a startup, or helping to build a mission-critical system for a large enterprise client. Perhaps you’ll work as an embedded craftsperson, working within our client's existing development to help them to get better at writing their own software. Or maybe you're more interested in helping to introduce the values of Craftsmanship to an organisation through coaching & mentoring.


##### What about you?
You consider yourself a software craftsperson. For you, writing code is part of your job and also a source of joy. Test-Driven Development is how you like to or would prefer to write code - preferring to work in small increments, trying things out and iterating rapidly, tightening the feedback loop as much as possible, and letting your tests drive the design of the code.

You are a team player. You understand that software lives on long after it is first delivered and that many different people will contribute to it over its lifetime.

As a curious developer, you spend time investing in your craft, learning new technologies and practicing different techniques and approaches.


##### We'd love to hear from you if you have:
Experience in at least one of the languages we use: JVM (Java/Clojure/Scala/Kotlin), .NET (C#/F#), or Node (JavaScript/TypeScript)
Familiarity with a cloud solution (AWS, Azure, Google Cloud Platform)
An appreciation for good development practices (Test-driven development, pair programming, continuous integration/deployment)
