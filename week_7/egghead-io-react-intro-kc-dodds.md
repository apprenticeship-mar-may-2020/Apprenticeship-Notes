Welcome to The Beginner’s Guide to React! 
I’m happy you’re here. I recommend that you 
watch all of these videos through once 
without touching the keyboard. Just take 
notes. Then you can watch them a second time 
and follow along and change/break the code 
and review the bits that you need. I’ll show 
you how I get things up and running, but 
feel free to copy/paste the code to an 
environment where you feel comfortable.
