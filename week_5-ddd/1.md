###### This is Martin Fowler's blog on Value Object:
https://martinfowler.com/bliki/ValueObject.html
```
When programming, I often find it's useful to represent things as a compound. A 2D coordinate consists of an x value and y value. An amount of money consists of a number and a currency. A date range consists of start and end dates, which themselves can be compounds of year, month, and day.

As I do this, I run into the question of whether two compound objects are the same. If I have two point objects that both represent the Cartesian coordinates of (2,3), it makes sense to treat them as equal. Objects that are equal due to the value of their properties, in this case their x and y coordinates, are called value objects.

But unless I'm careful when programming, I may not get that behavior in my programs

Say I want to represent a point in JavaScript.

const p1 = {x: 2, y: 3};
const p2 = {x: 2, y: 3};
assert(p1 !== p2);  // NOT what I want
Sadly that test passes. It does so because JavaScript tests equality for js objects by looking at their references, ignoring the values they contain.

In many situations using references rather than values makes sense. If I'm loading and manipulating a bunch of sales orders, it makes sense to load each order into a single place. If I then need to see if the Alice's latest order is in the next delivery, I can take the memory reference, or identity, of Alice's order and see if that reference is in the list of orders in the delivery. For this test, I don't have to worry about what's in the order. Similarly I might rely on a unique order number, testing to see if Alice's order number is on the delivery list.
```

###### These are information on Models and Value objects with Domain Modelling:
https://github.com/codurance/apprenticeship/wiki/Model,-Value-Objects,-Services
```
Values Objects in Java
One example that we can have for Value Objects, is an API that can register users, to register a new user you need a username, a password, and the password_confirmation. How should this information be represented as a value object?

public class RegistrationData {

    public final String username;
    public final String password;
    public final String password_confimation;
 
    public Position(String username, String password, String password_confimation) {
        this.username = username
        this.password = password
        this.password_confimation = password_confimation
    }
}
```

##### Services
##### A good SERVICE has three characteristics.

The operation relates to a domain concept that is not a natural part of an ENTITY or VALUE OBJECT.
The interface is defined in terms of other elements of the domain model.
The operation is stateless.
Eric Evans

There are three types of services:

Application Services
Domain Services
Infrastructure Services

##### Application Services
```
The Application Services are the direct clients of the domain model...

These are responsible for task coordination of use case flows, one service method per flow...

It is a mistake to consider Application Services to be the same as Domain Services. They are not.

We should strive to push all business domain logic into the domain model, whether that be in Aggregates, Value Objects, or Domain Services. Keep Application Services thin, using them only to coordinate tasks on the model.

Vaughn Vernon
```

Note: application services are equivalent to actions in Interaction-Driven Design

We are using this Application Service to coordinate the purchaseRepository and the model (in this case, the domain service PurchasesReportGenerator):
```
public class GeneratePurchasesReport {
    ...
    public void execute(Date from, Date to) {
	
        List<Purchase> purchases = purchasesRepository.find(from, to);
        
        PurchasesReport purchasesReport = new PurchasesReportGenerator().generate(purchases);
        
        ...
    } 
}
```

##### Domain Services
```
A Domain Service is a building block where the purpose is to host any code that makes some transformation in the domain, and don't belong to an Entity or a Value Object. Domain Services should be stateless with you passing all the data for the transformation in the parameters and returning the result of the transformation (following the idea of pure fabrication).

When a significant process or transformation in the domain is not a natural responsibility of an ENTITY or VALUE OBJECT, add an operation to the model as a standalone interface declared as a SERVICE. Define the interface in terms of the language of the model and make sure the operation name is part of the UBIQUITOUS LANGUAGE. Make the SERVICE stateless.
```
Eric Evans

This Domain Service is defined in terms of the UBIQUITOUS LANGUAGE (e.g. Purchase, PurchasesReport). It is stateless because it just takes data and produce more data. This responsibility doesn't fit in any ENTITY:
```
public class PurchasesReportGenerator {
    public PurchasesReport generate(List<Purchase> purchases) {
        ...
        // create a report based on purchases data
        ...
        return purchasesReport;
    }
}
```

#### Infrastructure Services:

Infrastructure Services
We might want to consult a third party API to store a report or sending an email. This is the kind of service that should be delegated to a Infrastructure Service.

In our case, what if we wanted to store a report somewhere and send an email notification when a new report is generated? We can have two Infrastructure Services to do all the hard work of exporting the report and sending an email.

This is an Application Service that coordinates a repository (purchasesRepository), a domain service (PurchasesReportGenerator) and two infrastructure services (purchasesReportWriter and emailService):
```
public class GeneratePurchasesReport {
    ...
    public void execute(Date from, Date to) {
	
        List<Purchase> purchases = purchasesRepository.find(from, to);
        
        PurchasesReport purchasesReport = new PurchasesReportGenerator().generate(purchases);
        
        purchasesReportWriter.export(purchasesReport);
        
        emailService.sendReportGeneratedNotification(from, to);
    } 
}
```
An infrastructure service for exporting a report:
```
public class PurchasesReportWriter {
    ...
    public void export(PurchasesReport purchasesReport) {
        // here we would have the code for adapting the report object to some format and writing it somewhere.
        System.out.println("Report exported in some format.");
    }
}
```
Another infrastructure service for sending email notifications:
```
public class EmailService {
    ...
    public void sendReportGeneratedNotification(Date from, Date to) {
        // here we would have the code for sending an email.
        System.out.println("Purchases report generated. Range from " + from + " to " + to);
    } 
}
```

###### This is a blog by Sandro Mancuso on Interaction Driven Design:
https://codurance.com/2017/12/08/introducing-idd/

```
Before reading this post, I strongly recommend you read the two previous blog posts that serve as a foundation to this blog: MVC, Delivery Mechanism and Domain Model and A Case for Outside-In Development.

Most software projects become very difficult to maintain and evolve after a period of time. Business is constantly complaining that things take forever to be delivered. Developers complain the code is a mess and that they struggle to understand it. They say the code is poorly designed, not reflecting business concepts and respective flows. Most often than not, they wrote the code themselves.

Development teams don’t normally have an efficient way to slice business features and design software in a way they can deliver software incrementally while keeping the codebase aligned to the business flows and easy to maintain.

A good software design process should help developers to clearly represent functional areas and business flows in their applications, aligning the changes in the business with their respective software components. A change in one area of the business should not cause multiple areas of the system to be changed. Identifying behaviour in the system should be straightforward and new developers should not have any problems to understand the code.
```

##### This is a DDD exercise called Acme Library

```
This is an exercise in building a software model a for an imaginary library. The focus should be only on the core domain, which in this case is a system for lending books. These are the rules according to which the library operates:

  Rules:
  - In order to borrow a book one needs to be registered with the library
  - Library has a catalog which says how many of each book is in stock
  - You can only borrow a book that is in stock
  - Only 2 books at a time
  - Books can be borrowed for 3 days
  - returning a book up to a week late incurs £5 fine
  - returning a book more than a week late uncurs £10 fine
  - books can be checked out or renewed at the Circulation Desk
  - a book can only be renewed once
  - Borrower can reserve a book that's not in stock
  in which case a hold is placed on the book and as soon
  as it is returned the borrower is notified and no one else can
  borrow the book.
```
