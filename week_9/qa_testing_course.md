This document describes the 2 week course that we will run for the Codurance Academy - Craftsperson-in-training programme. The idea is to provide a base for our craftspeople so that they can perform the role of an Agile QA. Our view is that this role is extremely important in any Agile team whether it is completely a Codurance team or a team with Codurance/Client mix.
