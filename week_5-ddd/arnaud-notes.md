##### Arnaud notes on Domain Driven Design are available here:

```
Hi all,
As discussed yesterday at the catch-up, I’ll post regular 
update on our learning on DDD.
Notes we’re taken on the book can
be found here
This is mostly made of quotes directly from the book. The goal 
is to use this as material with apprentices.
If you have any feedback, please 
comment here or directly modify on github.

If you want to help us, please do 
! (especially if you have real experience in DDD)
```
